## Welcome to the documentation of the Vinegar project!

- Vinegar is a transparent wrapper for Roblox Player and Roblox Studio.
- The software and documentation are both open source, and can be accessed [on GitHub](https://github.com/vinegarhq).
- There is no <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> for Vinegar at this time.
- Vinegar is an alternative to [Grapejuice](https://brinkervii.gitlab.io/grapejuice/).
- While the application does work, it is still under development, so there may be major changes.

To get started, proceed to [the installation guide](Installation/index.md)!
