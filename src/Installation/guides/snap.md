# Installation from Snap

<div class="warning">

**Unless you have a good reason not to use it, it is strongly recommended to [install Vinegar using Flatpak](../index.md).**

Running Vinegar and Roblox without Flatpak is prone to issues such as an incorrect Wine build, missing libraries, or improper configuration/installation.

Configuring things properly is possible, but involves effort and debugging if Roblox doesn't work out of the box. That's why using Flatpak is recommended; it sets up and configures everything automatically, so it has the best chance of working smoothly the first time without needing any adjustments.
