  **Sober is available through Flathub!**

  Great news! Sober is now more than ever easily available to download and install. After months and months of self-hosting, the devs have decided to open the access door a bit. No need to worry about installation errors and etc.

  To install, all you have to do is just make sure you have access to the Flathub remote and just type **`flatpak install --user flathub org.vinegarhq.Sober`**.

  > Please note: The Flathub version, until whitelisted for instant updates, will have updates delayed by upwards to 3 hours. If there is any issues that requires instant attention, there will be some downtime before it is able to reach all users.
